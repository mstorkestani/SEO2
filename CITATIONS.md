# Citations

This workshop references several articles and guides to provide up‑to‑date definitions, metrics and best practices.  The footnotes below correspond to in‑text citations in the README.

1. **Definition of Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO).** The BOL Agency defines GEO as the process of formatting, structuring and marketing content so that AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Grok and Gemini can easily understand, extract and cite it.  This represents a shift from page‑level rankings to passage‑level relevance【642233818778557†L117-L122】.

2. **Success metrics for SEO, AEO and GEO.** Traditional SEO focuses on rankings, traffic and conversions; AEO measures zero‑click visibility and citations; GEO measures cross‑platform citations, brand mentions and traffic from AI links【642233818778557†L201-L250】.

3. **Search is moving from links to language models.** Andreessen Horowitz notes that in generative interfaces visibility means showing up directly in the answer rather than ranking on a results page【323118844044712†L89-L104】.  Generative engines reward content that is well‑organised, easy to parse and dense with meaning【323118844044712†L116-L119】 and operate in a paywalled ecosystem where third‑party citations occur only when they add value【323118844044712†L121-L126】.

4. **Technical foundations of GEO.** Optimising for GEO involves creating passages that can stand alone, designing content for vector‑based retrieval, addressing multiple related queries, clarifying entity relationships and supporting multi‑step reasoning【642233818778557†L117-L160】.  Clear subject–predicate–object relationships and semantic completeness help AI systems understand and cite your content【642233818778557†L140-L151】【642233818778557†L152-L160】.

5. **Model parameter tuning.** Search Engine Land advises adjusting temperature and top‑p parameters to balance creativity and accuracy.  Lower values yield technically accurate, less unique content, whereas higher settings encourage more creative and diverse outputs【781085559410624†L339-L358】.

6. **Persona and audience pattern.** Assigning a persona (e.g. “legal SEO writing expert”) and audience in the prompt efficiently conveys multiple constraints and optimises the model’s behaviour【781085559410624†L380-L417】.

7. **Zero‑shot, one‑shot and many‑shot prompting.** Providing examples improves the consistency of outputs.  Zero‑shot prompts give no examples, one‑shot gives a single example and many‑shot includes several; this technique is particularly useful for tasks like writing title tags【781085559410624†L425-L491】.

8. **Follow‑all‑rules instruction.** Placing a directive such as “follow every instruction” at the start of a prompt increases the chance that the AI will adhere to all specified guidelines【781085559410624†L503-L520】.

9. **Question refinement pattern.** Asking the model to refine or generate questions before answering promotes deeper reasoning and more comprehensive responses【781085559410624†L522-L534】.

10. **Iterative precision.** Feeding a prompt back into the model and using its feedback to refine the wording helps craft more precise and effective instructions【781085559410624†L548-L568】.

11. **Prompt engineering best practices.** Olaf Kopp’s guide recommends starting with a clear task and context, breaking instructions into logical steps, providing examples, using role‑based personas, iteratively refining prompts, employing advanced reasoning techniques, specifying model parameters, using emotional cues when appropriate and exploring domain‑specific prompt libraries【990875333465504†L94-L181】【990875333465504†L184-L197】.

12. **Adjusting parameters to influence outputs.** Changing temperature or top‑p values can alter the diversity and creativity of the model’s responses, an important lever for SEO tasks like keyword research or creative writing【781085559410624†L339-L358】.
